# Behavioral-Modeling-of-PLL-using-Deep-Learning
Behavioral modeling of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) using deep learning involves training neural networks to predict and simulate the dynamic behavior and performance of PLL circuits. This approach enhances accuracy in capturing nonlinearities and complex interactions within the PLL system compared to traditional modeling techniques.
